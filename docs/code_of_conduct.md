# Code of Conduct for members and affiliates

!!! note

    This is a living document, it may be worth revisiting from time to time to reflect on our purpose and goals. It is also not a legally binding document, but is shared as a reasonable expectation for participating in our group's activities.

## Preamble
We value the participation of all members and colleagues in our community and want to ensure that all feel welcome, valued, and fulfilled in both personal and professional matters. We also hold our work and communication with others to high standards, and encourage those around us to do the same. To affirm these values and cultivate a positive and productive environment all members of the Bennett research group are expected to uphold these standards. 

## Social Code of Conduct
The pursuit of scientific truths and applied advancements is best developed in a friendly, inclusive, and fulfilling environment. To this end, all members of the group are entitled to a space free of harassment and hostility. We ask that all members conduct themselves according to the following principles:

 - Communication whether in person, online, professional, or personal must remain appropriate in professional contexts and be culturally considerate and inclusive.
 - Harassment, including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention will not be tolerated.
 - Be mindful in group discussion so that all can particate and that a variety of viewpoints can be expresses.
 - Take a "yes and" perspective. Be generous when attributing credit and praise. Positivity encourages the best work.
 - Mentorship occurs at all career and educational stages. Make efforts to build relationships with your collaborators and communicate not only about technical aspects of work but also about the environment in which that work is situated.

## Research Code of Conduct
Academic research is rooted in a desire to push our understanding of the world forward. Such work is, by definition, at the edge of our knowledge and should be treated with internal skepticism and researchers should act in accordance with ethical principles ensuring both validity and reproducibility.  Researchers also bring their unique viewpoint and methodological perspective to their work that should be both communicated by investigators and sought to be understood by those participating in the work.

At a more basic level, a majority of research products developed by the Bennett research group are anticipated to be computational in nature. Good stewardship of methods, code, and data are all expected. Specific to these points we expect:

- All code used to produce publications made public and be cleaned to a reasonable standard (not rely on hidden variables, clearly have workflow steps ordered, have a computational environment specified). Code possibly useful to future collaborators should be made public on the Bennett Research Group GitHub page either as a standalone repository or a fork of a personal repository as appropriate.
- Datasets be adequately documentated with metadata and a clear path of provenance. Datasets used for publications which are not prohibitively large should be published via public repositories (i.e. zenodo; figshare; hydroshare)
- Provide documentation, whether in code or via technical writeups, of mathematical methods developed or employed in projects where methods development is a significant portion of the research effort.
- Be clear on the sources of upstream codebases and datasets. Do not claim false ownership over the works of others.

## Research and Workplace Expectations 
A large component of all research careers, particularly during graduate schools, is in developing an independent work ethic, drive to build new tools and understanding, and developing a unique taste for research approaches and problems. These higher ideals are often developed alongside considerable hardship including the development of imposter syndrome, a deep sense of career uncertainty, and financial insecurity. To recognize a troubling fact: Conducting research often comes in fits and starts, from scientific, emotional, and financial perspectives. As such, building a strong, collaborative research community is crucial to the success of all of our members. 

I (Andrew, as the group lead) respect and recognise that many group members will have external personal obligations and responsibilties that not only go beyond, but may supercede, your obligations to your research and/or studies. I hope that you feel comfortable in communicating such matters to me personally, but also want to make space for you to exercise judgement in such matters. To strike a balance between your research obligations and other external affairs I am fully supportive of remote work when communicated generally. I expect a reasonable amount of work hours to be conducted within the Arizona time zone between the hours of roughly 8am to 6pm, and preferably between 10am to 4pm. I expect you will be responsive during these hours at least 3 days a week via email or slack, with obvious exceptions for coursework and travel. I pledge to be similarly available and make my calendar public to all funded students and collaborators.

You are highly encouraged to take/use holiday/leave as you see fit, but please let me know when you expect to take leave as soon as possible. A benefit of your studies/work with the group will be external travel to present at conferences or work with collaborators. I am highly supportive of "piggy-backing" off of these trips to take vacations or other forms of leave so that you can experience the world as you work. Similarly, if there are regions of the world that you wish to develop collaborations, let me know and I will do my best to find opportunities for funding travel and make connections.

### Group meetings and individual meetings
Each term I will schedule an individual meeting for at least 30 minutes per week and a group meeting for an hour a week for all group members. Group members funded on external projects may be asked to participate in meetings with external partners which will be coordinated as funding as developed.
