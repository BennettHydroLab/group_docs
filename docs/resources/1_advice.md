# Advice and tips for doing research

These are some things that I have found helpful/insightful about how to do research or think about hydrology and science in general. I will add to this list as I find more things that I think are useful.

## General science
- [Adam Mastroianni - Science is a Strong Link Problem](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/science-is-a-strong-link-problem)
- [Richard Hamming - You and Your Research](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1/fp/lectures/hamming.pdf)

## Hydrology stuff
- [Klemes - Dilettantism in hydrology: Transition or destiny?](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR022i09Sp0177S)

## Mathematical stuff
