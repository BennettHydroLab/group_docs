# Contributing to the group docs

This site is built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the [mkdocs-material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). To get the latest state of the docs you can simply clone them as:

```
git clone https://github.com/BennettHydroLab/group_docs.git
```

If you are an authorized group member you should have direct push/commit access. If you are an external collaborator you may need to interact with our docs via a pull request.

As an authorized user, you should be able to push new edits to the documentation by commiting your changes to the `main` branche and then running `mkdocs gh-deploy` from your local environment.
